## Introduction
Welcome to this GitHub project focusing on **Bitcoin’s role in a 3-asset portfolio**. The main objective here is to analyze the findings from an academic study and then replicate or extend those findings using more recent data. While I hold a strong interest in Bitcoin as an asset, please note this is **not** financial or investment advice but rather an **educational** exploration.

## Motivation & Background
I’ve been interested in economics since my school days. However, it wasn’t until I suffered an accident (requiring three surgical interventions) that I found the time to revisit my fascination with financial markets. During recovery, I delved deeper into how monetary policy and inflation affect our daily lives—especially as these factors seemed to magnify following the COVID-19 pandemic.

My interest in Bitcoin arose around 2024, though I was aware of it much earlier. Initially, I viewed Bitcoin as a speculative vehicle. Over time, however, the persistent erosion of purchasing power in traditional currencies led me to consider Bitcoin’s potential as more than just a tool for speculation.

### Preliminary Observations & Thoughts
- **Inflation & Fiat Devaluation**:  
  - A euro today buys only about 58.207% of what it did in 2000.  
  - A dollar today buys only about 53.847% of what it did in 2000.  
  - A franc today buys only about 86.192% of what it did in 2000.

- **Limited Supply & Decentralization**:  
  Bitcoin’s capped supply (21 million coins) appeals to those concerned about central banks’ ability to print money indefinitely. Its decentralized ledger (spread across many computers) also makes it less susceptible to corruption or unilateral control.

- **Risk & Volatility**:  
  Bitcoin remains a relatively new and **risky** asset compared to more established investments like equities or gold. Nonetheless, risk is a part of its allure and underscores why careful analysis is necessary before making any decisions.

- **Housing Prices in Gold Terms**:  
  - **2000**: €1,800 per m² / €248 per oz of gold ≈ **7.26 ounces of gold** per m².  
  - **2024**: €4,500 per m² / €2,884 per oz of gold ≈ **1.56 ounces of gold** per m².  
  - **Interpretation**: Despite the nominal rise in housing prices in Madrid, the cost per square meter **decreased by approximately 78%** when measured in gold between 2000 and 2024. This suggests that gold has appreciated at a faster rate than real estate in Madrid over this period.

- **Bitcoin as a Long-Term Store of Value**:  
  I believe Bitcoin has characteristics akin to gold. Its long-term price behavior shows that, while it can be volatile, it may serve as a store of value over a multi-year horizon. For instance, someone who bought Bitcoin on **December 16, 2017**, at around **$16,000**, had to wait until **2020** to see the price return to that same valuation. This perspective implies that if you invest in Bitcoin, you might not be overly concerned about its price movements in the short term (e.g., 1–5 years).

## About the Original Study
- **Title**: *The Role of Bitcoin in a 3-Asset Portfolio*  
- **Author**: Phillip Schottler  
- **Date of Publication**: June 14, 2022  
- **Data Range**: *September 17, 2014 – November 17, 2021*  
- **Link**: [Study on DataCamp Datalab](https://www.datacamp.com/datalab/w/21cc7714-89b7-48e4-b1b3-7733e95e536a)

This study examines how Bitcoin can impact the returns and risk profile of a portfolio that otherwise consists of more traditional assets. It explores correlations, volatility, and overall diversification benefits. My plan is to look at this original analysis, replicate it with the same date range, and then apply a similar framework using **updated data** to see if the conclusions still hold.
